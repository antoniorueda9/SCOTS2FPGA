**Introduction**

This project takes one symbolic controller generated by Scots v0.2 (.scs + .bdd) and generates the necessary files to be burnt onto a myRIO FPGA from National Instruments.

**Third party software**
The open source libraries that has been used along with this project are in the ext folder.

The next ones don't require building and installation:

1. SCOTSv2.0 (https://gitlab.lrz.de/matthias/SCOTSv0.2) - tool to generate symbolic controllers
2. scots_opt_det (https://github.com/ivan-zapreev/SCOTS2C) - tool to determinize controllers
3. ABC (https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/) - tool to convert .blif files to verilog language

The next one require building and installation:

4. CUDDv3.0.0 (http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/) - the Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD) management library

The instructions on building and installing the latter one (on two supported platforms) are given in the next section.

This project was tested on Ubuntu and the CUDD library can be compiled as (extracted from https://github.com/ivan-zapreev/SCOTS2C):

```
export CUDDPATH=/usr/local
cd ./ext/cudd-3.0.0
./configure --enable-shared --enable-obj \
--enable-dddmp --prefix=${CUDDPATH}
make
sudo make install
```

-  Make sure that the `./ext/cudd-3.0.0/util/util.h` and `./ext/cudd-3.0.0/config.h` have been copied into `${CUDDPATH}/include` by running

```
find ${CUDDPATH}/include -name "util.h"
find ${CUDDPATH}/include -name "config.h"
```

-  If one of the header files was not copied then use an appropriate command

```
sudo cp ./ext/cudd-3.0.0/util/util.h ${CUDDPATH}/include
sudo cp ./ext/cudd-3.0.0/config.h ${CUDDPATH}/include
```

**Building the software**

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

**Running the examples**
Inside the folder examples of the project, we have 6 scripts (The scripts can be modified to include or remove any example):

1. *0-build.sh* - This script will build the examples from Scots inside the models folder

2. *1-run.sh* - It will generate the .scs and .bdd files

3. *2-determinize.sh* - It will determinize the controller, saving the files in the blgdet folder

4. *3-generate_blif.sh* - It will convert the previous files to .blif format, saving the files into blif_file

5. *4-verilog_and_wrapper.sh* - It will create the .vhd file necessary for myRIO FPGA. The generated files will be located in FPGA_files

The last 2 files were created to check another aproach, in this case, the controller will be not modified

6. *5-generate_blif_whole.sh* - It will convert the previous files to .blif format, saving the files into blif_file_whole

7. *6-verilog_and_wrapper_whole.sh* - It will create the .vhd file necessary for myRIO FPGA. The generated files will be located in FPGA_files_whole
