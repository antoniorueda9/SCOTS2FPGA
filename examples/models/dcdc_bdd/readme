Controller synthesis for a DC DC boost converter to enforce a reach-and-stay 
specification

0. to run this example, you need to the Cudd libarary installed. Please see the
   manual for installation notes.


1. compile the dcdc.cc and simulate.cc file

  a) edit the Makefile and adjust the CUDDPATH to the location where the cudd library is installed.

  b) now you should be able to compile the program simply by

    $ make

2. execute 

  $./dcdc     
  computes the symbolic model and synthesizes the controller; the result is
  stored in controller.scs

  $./simulate
  reads the controller from file and performs the closed loop simulation.


3. simulate the closed loop in Matlab 

  a) you need to compile the mexfile first (see the readme in $(SCOTSROOT)/mfiles/mexfiles )

  b) in Matlab add the path and run the simulation 

   >> addpath(genpath('../../../mfiles'))
   >> dcdc
